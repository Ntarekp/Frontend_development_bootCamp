# Frontend Development BootCamp

Welcome to my Frontend Development BootCamp repository!

## About This Project

This project marks my transition into frontend development, focusing on building modern web interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. My goal is to master the core technologies that power the web and create interactive, responsive, and visually appealing user experiences.

## Why Frontend Development?

After exploring various areas in software development, I decided to specialize in frontend development because:

- **Creativity:** It allows me to bring ideas to life visually.
- **User Experience:** I enjoy crafting interfaces that are intuitive and engaging.
- **Continuous Learning:** The frontend ecosystem is dynamic, offering endless opportunities to learn and grow.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring web content.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and dynamic content.
